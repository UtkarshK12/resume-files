"about":"A passionate backend developer who occasionally fiddles around with frontend technologies. I graduated from IIT Delhi in 2021, and was recruited by Accenture Japan on campus. I've been honing my skills in Java, Spring boot, Python, Relational Databases, Bash Scripting, Messaging systems etc. When I'm not coding, you'll find me solving chess puzzles, enjoying outdoor sports, or exploring the latest in cinema. My commitment to continuous learning drives me to regularly engage with coding challenges and read blogs to stay abreast of emerging tech trends. I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects or discuss the latest in tech â€“ so feel free to reach out and connect!"
